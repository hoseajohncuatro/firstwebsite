        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>Early Inhabitants: The region now known as Tanzania has a history of human habitation dating back tens of thousands of years. Archaeological evidence suggests that various indigenous peoples inhabited the area, engaging in hunting, gathering, and early forms of agriculture.</p>
        <p>Coastal Trade and Swahili Culture: The coastal areas of Tanzania, including Zanzibar, were part of the Swahili Coast, a region characterized by trade and cultural exchange. Arab and Persian traders established settlements along the coast, contributing to the development of Swahili culture, language, and Islam.</p>
        <p>Portuguese and Omani Influence: In the late 15th century, Portuguese explorers, including Vasco da Gama, arrived on the Swahili Coast and established control over several coastal cities. However, they were eventually pushed out by the Omani Arabs in the 17th century.</p>
        <p>Omani Sultanate: Zanzibar became the center of Omani influence in the region, and it played a pivotal role in the Indian Ocean trade routes. The Omani Sultanate ruled Zanzibar and parts of the mainland.</p>
        <p>German Colonial Rule: In the late 19th century, European colonial powers scrambled for control of African territories. The German East Africa Company established control over mainland Tanzania, including areas around present-day Dar es Salaam.</p>
        <p>British Control: During World War I, British and Belgian forces captured German East Africa. After the war, the region was placed under British administration as the Tanganyika Territory under a League of Nations mandate.</p>
        <p>Zanzibar Revolution: On January 12, 1964, a revolution in Zanzibar led by local African nationalists overthrew the Arab elite ruling the island. This revolution marked the end of Arab dominance in Zanzibar.</p>
        <p>Path to Independence: Tanganyika (mainland Tanzania) achieved independence from British colonial rule on December 9, 1961, under the leadership of Julius Nyerere and the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). The country became a republic in 1962.</p>
        <p>Union with Zanzibar: On April 26, 1964, Tanganyika and Zanzibar united to form the United Republic of Tanzania. This union was led by Julius Nyerere, who became the first President of the united country, and Abeid Karume, the President of Zanzibar.</p>
        <p>Before 1960, Tanzania's history was characterized by a blend of indigenous cultures, trade, and the influence of various colonial and imperial powers, including the Portuguese, Arabs, Germans, and British. The path to independence and the formation of the modern nation of Tanzania were significant historical events during this period.</p>
